This is a Tensorflow implementation of the object detector described by the paper "Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks" by He et al. (NIPS2015) and "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" by He et al. (CVPR2016). Given an image, it predicts the bounding box and label of each object in the image. It uses a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to find a set of rectangular cadidate regions, and uses a Fast R-CNN to classify these regions. To improve the efficiency, the RPN and Fast R-CNN modules share their convolutional layers. These convolutional layers can be initialized from VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101 or ResNet152 model, and these models can be obtained by using Caffe-to-Tensorflow.
