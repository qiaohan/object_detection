This is a Tensorflow implementation of the object detector described by the paper "Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks" by Ren et al. (NIPS2015) and "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" by He et al. (CVPR2016). Given an image, it predicts the bounding box and label of each object in the image. It uses a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to find a set of rectangular cadidate regions, and uses a Fast R-CNN to classify these regions. To improve the efficiency, the RPN and Fast R-CNN modules share their convolutional layers. These convolutional layers are inherited from VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101 or ResNet152 model, and these models can be obtained by using Caffe-to-Tensorflow. 

Note 
----
I perform the RoI pooling layer by concatenating a RoI warping layer and a standard max pooling layer, as suggested by the paper "Instance-aware Semantic Segmentation via Multi-task Network Cascades" by Dai et al. Currently, the RoI warping layer is implemented in NumPy. It can be also implemented in Tensorflow, but doing so seems to result in an unusually large Tensorflow model. It is left as future work to incorporate everything into Tensorflow and accomplish end-to-end training of the whole system.
